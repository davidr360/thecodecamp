# The Code Camp
Completed code for Shawn Wildermuth's Building an API with ASP.NET Web API course on Pluralsight. The course is located here: https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/aspnet-web-api-building

This code includes the notes I made as I followed along with the course. Notes are highlighted with HACK comments which show up by default in Visual Studio's Task List.

The course is an excellent introduction to Web API on ASP.NET MVC - 5 stars.
